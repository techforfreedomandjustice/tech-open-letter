<p>The horrors taking place in Gaza over the past six months are irreconcilable with any notions of a shared humanity and human rights. Israel has killed over 30,000 people, including more than 12,000 children. Israel has also forcibly displaced nearly 2 million people - all while depriving them of critical humanitarian supplies. The people of the Gaza Strip are currently grappling with widespread famine, disease and displacement.</p>

<p>While many in the community rushed to support Israel following October 7th, the deafening silence surrounding the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza disregards the sanctity of human life. This catastrophe demands our immediate attention, empathy and unwavering collective action. As James Baldwin famously said, “these are all our children”.</p>

<p>As members of the global venture and tech community, we recognize the imperative for decisive action in pursuit of progress and positive change. We urgently call upon our community to stand in support of human rights and against extremism, advocating vocally for peace, justice, and the well-being of all individuals affected, including the immediate release of all civilian hostages and prisoners. The continued death and destruction in Gaza and settler violence in the West Bank will not bring peace and security to the world.</p>

<p>We implore all members of our community to use all resources at their disposal to push for an immediate ceasefire, increased humanitarian aid and justice for all; in particular the Palestinian people, who have lived under military occupation for over 75 years.</p>

<p>Selective outrage and empathy are antithetical to the values that our community professes to uphold. We must demonstrate unwavering consistency in our advocacy for human rights and in our condemnation of all forms of hate, including antisemitism, anti-Palestinian bigotry, and islamophobia. It is imperative that we collectively denounce any manifestation of violence or injustice, regardless of its origin.</p>

<p>Together, through united action, we possess the capacity to effect meaningful change, to promote peace, to alleviate the suffering in Gaza and to champion justice for all in the region and across the globe.</p>
